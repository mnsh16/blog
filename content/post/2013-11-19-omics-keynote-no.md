I got the following email:

> Dear Dr. Broman,
>
> Greetings.  Although we have not met, I believe that you know one of my colleagues [clip].  He regards you very highly, and after seeing your credentials I can understand why !
>
> On behalf of the organizing committee, I am writing to invite you to be a keynote speaker at the 3rd International Conference & Exhibition on Biometrics & Biostatistics, which is scheduled for July 14-16, 2014, in Baltimore MD.  Please see <http://www.omicsgroup.com/biometrics-biostatistics-conference-2014> for the conference webpage and <http://www.omicsgroup.com/conferences/biometrics-biostatistics-2013/Biometrics_finalprogram.pdf> to view the program from the previous conference.  Although the schedule for the upcoming conference has not yet been constructed, I anticipate that a keynote speaker will have approximately 40 minutes to talk.  Moreover, my understanding is that the OMICS Group will waive the registration fee for a keynote speaker and will also cover two nights' stay at the conference hotel.

> Please let me know if you are available to participate.

My response:

> Dear [clip],

> Thanks for thinking of me, but I must decline to participate.

> I've only heard bad things about OMICS Group Conferences. They appear to exploit scientists desperate for recognition.

> The registration fee for the meeting is extraordinarily high (\$800 now; \$1000 after March 21), and looking at [the agenda for the 2013 meeting](http://www.omicsgroup.com/conferences/biometrics-biostatistics-2013/Biometrics_finalprogram.pdf), it's hard to see how that could be worth it to anyone. Particularly odd is the session on Day 3 in which 4 of the 5 talks share the same title.
