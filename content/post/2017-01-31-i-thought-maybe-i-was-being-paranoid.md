An odd thing happened to me on twitter today.

[UW System](https://twitter.com/uwsystem) had [tweeted a statement](https://twitter.com/UWSystem/status/826167903145775104) from system president [Ray Cross](https://twitter.com/raywcross) concerning Trump's [executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html) banning refugees and immigrants from 7 countries. Cross's statement is close to the most empty, useless possible such statement.

So I [tweeted back](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568), asking him to revise his statement and actually take a stand against Trump's executive order.

Note that I mentioned not just [@RayWCross](https://twitter.com/raywcross) and [@UWSystem](https://twitter.com/uwsystem), but also [@POTUS](https://twitter.com/potus).

Twenty minutes later, the tweet had gotten a couple of ❤️'s, and then one RT, but for some reason the tweet itself had disappeared from my twitter feed (in the app I use, [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)). I looked at [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/kwbroman) in a web browser, and sure enough the tweet wasn't there.

Puzzled, and knowing I hadn't deleted the tweet, I poked around and was able to find, somehow, the URL for the original tweet, and I could see [the tweet](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568) in a browser. So it hadn't been _deleted_, it had just been removed from my feed.

[@Kerri_Gilbert](https://twitter.com/kerri_gilbert) then [wrote](https://twitter.com/Kerri_Gilbert/status/826181462567297025) that she could see it in her feed but not if she went to my timeline. So I wasn't completely crazy.

[@CFlensburg](https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/) later [wrote](https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/status/826231062460129280) that he could see the tweet, but [he's in Australia](https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/status/826232029549178880).

Now my hypothesis was: someone who looks after [@potus](https://twitter.com/potus) had somehow suppressed my tweet. Or was I being paranoid?

A quick google search (for "tweet disappeared from feed") revealed a [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com) article from 2015-10-30, "[Tweets are disappearing on Twitter. Why?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/30/a-guide-to-why-some-activists-believe-their-tweets-are-being-censored-in-the-u-s/)" This seems to explain what happened: my tweet was suppressed by some kind of "abuse filter."

The article is an interesting read. It describes the experience of [Paul Dietrich](http://members.efn.org/~paulmd/) ([@Paulmd199](https://twitter.com/paulmd199)), who wrote an analysis of his situation: "[Adventures in Twitter Censorship.](http://members.efn.org/~paulmd/OwnWork/AdventuresinCensorship.pdf)" Also an interesting read.

And note that the tweet suppression is location-specific. It's okay for [Australians](https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/) to read [the tweet](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568), but Americans need to be protected from it.

#### But why this tweet?

This [tweet of mine](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568) was really a pretty bland tweet. I mean, I was directly criticizing my [boss](http://www.med.wisc.edu/about/administration/robert-golden-md/38)'s [boss](https://chancellor.wisc.edu/about/)'s [boss](https://twitter.com/raywcross), and we [just barely have tenure at Wisconsin](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/regents-committee-passes-new-uw-madison-tenure-policy-with-changes/article_8249f119-05e7-5459-b4d8-25eab3e3882c.html) anymore, so I certainly wasn't going to be abusive. I'm not sure why I actually mentioned [@potus](https://twitter.com/potus), but I figured, "What the hell."

But what sort of abuse detection algorithm would decide that [this tweet](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568) was abusive? If there's an abuse filter that would suppress [this tweet](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568) but not all of the actual abuse rampant on twitter...well that's bullshit.

Maybe it was that I wrote "Sad." (I thought that was funny. And hardly abusive.)

I favor the theory that it wasn't an algorithm but rather a person: that someone is assigned to read all mentions of [@potus](https://twitter.com/potus) and if they deem something inappropriate, they flip a switch and the tweet gets suppressed.

So maybe I _am_ paranoid.

(I forgot to mention: [@NickFleisher](https://twitter.com/nickfleisher) had the best response to [Ray Cross's lame statement](https://twitter.com/UWSystem/status/826167903145775104): "[Revise and resubmit](https://twitter.com/nickfleisher/status/826184115456143360).")
