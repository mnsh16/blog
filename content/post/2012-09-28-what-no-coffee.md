I was at a [CIDR Access Committee](http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/about/CIDR%20Access%20Committee.pdf) meeting in DC a few weeks ago. We review proposals for genotyping or sequencing by the [Center for Inherited Disease Research](http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu), a service funded by several of the NIH institutes.

We had to buy our own coffee.

It's silly to complain. There was a coffee shop across the hall from the meeting room, and the coffee there was suitable.

But isn't it silly to pay airfare for a dozen people for a 3 hr meeting and then chintz on the snacks?  Apparently it's a [new government rule](http://www.hhs.gov/asfr/ogapa/acquisition/appfundspol_att2.html).  (I'd thought the rule was maybe instituted following the [GSA's Las Vegas party](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/us/politics/gsa-las-vegas-trip-is-the-talk-of-washington.html), but it predates that.)

Without coffee, [grant reviewing does not seem to go as well](http://www.freestatebrewing.com).
