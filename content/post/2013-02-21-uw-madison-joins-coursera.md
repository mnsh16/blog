UW-Madison is joining Coursera to offer four massive open online courses (MOOCs).

I like [Sara Goldrick-Rab's comments](http://eduoptimists.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-illusory-appeal-of-uw-madison-moocs.html).

MOOCs are a good thing, but I view them as "outreach".  There are lots of problems with universities, but MOOCs don't seem to be a solution to any of them.

I like Sara's point about MOOCs more being used more for continuing education for the already educated vs new access for the uneducated.
