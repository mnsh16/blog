There was [an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/at-moneyball-u-what-are-the-odds.html) in the New York Times on Sunday about teaching statistics through sports examples.

I personally would avoid sports entirely, as I view the subject to be insufficiently serious.  Maybe that's an indication of my being a terrible instructor of introductory statistics: I don't care that much what the students are interested in.

Certainly lots of statisticians are interested in sports.  [David Brillinger](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~brill/) told me he'd learned a lot of statistics from studying sports.  And I'm not completely uninterested in sports: I like to watch football, particularly Nebraska, Green Bay, and Baltimore, and to see Notre Dame or any team from Florida or Texas lose.

But statistics about sports?  Yawn.
