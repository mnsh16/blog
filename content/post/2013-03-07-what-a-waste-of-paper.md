A university press asked me to review a book manuscript, and the author "has asked that we not use electronic copies." So they're going to send me a hard copy.

My response: "If you only give me a paper copy, I'm going to just scan it and toss the paper. That seems like a waste of time (and paper and postage)."

I should probably have said, "Then forget it."

Their response included, "What you do with it when it arrives I am just going to take a hear-no-evil approach to."
