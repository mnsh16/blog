At the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) workshop at  [UW-Madison in August, 2014](https://github.com/UW-Madison-ACI/boot-camps/blob/2014-08-25/README.md), one of the students suggested that we hand out some cheat sheets on each topic. I thought that was a really good idea.

So at the SWC workshop at [Washington State University this week](http://karawoo.com/2015-04-27-wsu/), we handed out the following five pages:

  * [ddplyr](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) (from RStudio)

  * [ggplot2](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) (from RStudio)

  * [unix command line](http://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/pdf/) (from Dave Child at Cheatography)

  * [git](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) (from GitHub)

  * [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) (from RStudio)

I really appreciate the work (and design sense) that were put into these.
