The transition from graduate student or postdoc to tenure-track faculty member is hard. You discover that there are a ton of new things to learn.

Here are some thoughts on things to _avoid_.

  * You may see lots of ways in which your department could be improved; don't try to fix all of them at once.

  * You may see needs for many new courses.  Don't try to develop all of them.  Try to teach the same courses at least three years in a row.

  * Don't agree to work with just any student who asks.  While a good student can really help, a bad student can suck up all your time and energy. Students may be worried about money and feigning interest in order to get a research position, but if they're not _really_ interested, they won't make much progress and it will be bad for both of you.

  * Don't agree to collaborate with someone in the two weeks before a grant deadline. You might get stuck in a commitment with some total jerk.  Find out if you'd really enjoy working with them, first.

  * Don't agree to write a book chapter.  It's almost as much work as a formal paper, but not as many people will read it and it won't count for much on your CV.
