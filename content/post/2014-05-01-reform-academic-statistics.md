[Terry Speed](http://www.wehi.edu.au/faculty_members/professor_terry_speed) recently gave a [talk](http://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/ict/calendar/Pages/Terry-Speed.aspx) on the role of statisticians in "Big Data" initiatives (see the [video](http://vimeo.com/91502942) or just look at the [slides](http://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/ict/events/Documents/Terry%20Speed_Data%20Science,%20Big%20Data%20and%20Statistics%20-%20Can%20We%20All%20Live%20Together.pdf)). He points to the history of statisticians' discussions of massive data sets (e.g., the [Proceedings of a 1998 NRC workshop on Massive data sets](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5505)) and how this history is being ignored in the current Big Data hype, and that statisticians, generally, are being ignored.

I was thinking of writing a polemic on the need for reform of academic statistics and biostatistics, but in reading back over [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org) posts, I've decided that [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/) and [Jeff Leek](jtleek.com) have already said what I wanted to say, and so I think I'll just summarize their points.

Following the [RSS](http://www.rss.org.uk/) [Future of the Statistical Sciences Workshop](http://www.worldofstatistics.org/presentations-and-panelists), Rafael was [quite optimistic](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/18/feeling-optimistic-after-the-future-of-the-statistical-sciences-workshop) about the prospects for academic statistics, as he noted considerable consensus on the following points:

  * We need to engage in real present-day problems

  * Computing should be a big part of our PhD curriculum

  * We need to deliver solutions

  * We need to improve our communication skills

Jeff said, "[Data science only poses a threat to (bio)statistics if we don't adapt,](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/04/15/data-science-only-poses-a-threat-to-biostatistics-if-we-dont-adapt/)" and made the following series of proposals:

  * Remove some theoretical requirements and add computing requirements to statistics curricula.

  * Focus on statistical writing, presentation, and communication as a main part of the curriculum.

  * Focus on positive interactions with collaborators (being a scientist) rather than immediately going to the referee attitude.

  * Add a unit on translating scientific problems to statistical problems.

  * Add a unit on data munging and getting data from databases.

  * Integrating real and live data analyses into our curricula.

  * Make all our students create an R package (a data product) before they graduate.

  * Most important of all have a "big tent" attitude about what constitutes statistics.

I agree strongly with what they've written. To make it happen, we ultimately need to reform our _values_.

Currently, we (as a field) appear satisfied with

  * Papers that report new methods with no usable software

  * Applications that focus on toy problems

  * Talks that skip the details of the scientific context of a problem

  * Data visualizations that are both ugly and ineffective

Further, we tend to get more excited about the _fanciness_ of a method than its _usefulness_.

We _should_ value

  * Usefulness above fanciness

  * Tool building (e.g., usable software)

  * Data visualization

  * In-depth knowledge of the scientific context of a problem

In evaluating (bio)statistics faculty, we should consider not just the number of _JASA_ or _Biometrics_ papers they've published, but also whether they've made themselves useful, and to the scientific community and well as to other statisticians.
