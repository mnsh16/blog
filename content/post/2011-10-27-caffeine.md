A cute and useful menu bar application for Macs: [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/), available in the [App store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225).

If you click the little coffee cup in your menu bar (so that it's full), it will prevent your Mac from displaying its screen saver or dimming its screen.  This is especially useful when you're giving a talk.
